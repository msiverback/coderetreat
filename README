A simple setup for writing Game of life katas in several
languages. First trial with Docker.

Build a docker image from the Dockerfile to setup the environment.
Run the image from repo top with:
docker run -v $(pwd)/coderetreat:/coderetreat -it coderetreat

From inside the container use the run scripts to start the codersdojo script for each language.
